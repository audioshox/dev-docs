# Currency-Specific Promotions

When creating a promotion, you can configure the promotion to target a single currency. The promotion will only run when the shopper selects the same transactional currency within the cart and checkout.

Here is an example promotion that offers 20 USD off garden material. This promotion will only run if the shopper is using USD as a transactional currency.
